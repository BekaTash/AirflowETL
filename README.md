**Overview**
This ETL process is a sleek demonstration of setting up an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline utilizing publicly available .csv data. The pipeline leverages Apache Airflow for workflow management to showcase how one might approach constructing a robust data pipeline with open-source tools and Python.

The project is designed to provide a template for integrating various data sources and performing data transformations in a scalable manner. It's an exemplary model, especially useful for those new to the concept of ETL processes, data orchestration with Airflow, or anyone interested in operationalizing data workflows with public datasets.

**Prerequisites**
Before diving into the ETL workflow, ensure that your machine is prepped with the necessary tools. This includes the installation of Apache Airflow, various Airflow providers, and SQLAlchemy for database interactions. Here's a rundown of what you need and how to get each piece:

**Apache Airflow
The backbone of our workflow management - includes classes and utilities essential for defining and executing DAGs.

pip install apache-airflow

**Postgres Operator**
A set of tools within the Airflow providers' suite, tailored for PostgreSQL database operations. This is critical for our database tasks within the DAG.

pip install apache-airflow-providers-postgres

**HTTP Sensor**
Another piece of the Airflow providers' collection, this sensor checks for the availability of a specified HTTP resource. We use this to verify our data endpoints before ingestion.

pip install apache-airflow-providers-http

**SQLAlchemy**
Our chosen ORM for database interactions - grants us the SQL superpowers in Python, enabling seamless database transactions.

pip install sqlalchemy

**Python Standard Libraries
The datetime and timedelta modules come with Python out of the box, facilitating date and time manipulation without any additional installation steps.

**Data Source**
The ETL pipeline is structured around public .csv data sources. This illustrates the power of Airflow in handling data in diverse formats and from varying origins, a common scenario in real-world data engineering tasks.

Remember to verify that all prerequisites are met before you embark on setting up the DAG to avoid any unexpected hiccups. Now, let's get that data flowing!
